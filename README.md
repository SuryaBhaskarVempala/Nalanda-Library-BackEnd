# üìö Nalanda Library Backend API

## Overview

The **Nalanda Library Backend** is a RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, designed to manage library operations such as book management, member registration, borrowing, and returning of books. It utilizes **MongoDB** for data storage and employs **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and authorization.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and list books.
- **Member Management**: Register and authenticate members.
- **Borrowing System**: Borrow and return books with transaction tracking.
- **Admin Reports**: View library statistics and activity reports.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiate access levels for admins and members.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: [Express.js]
- **Database**: [MongoDB]
- **Authentication**: [JWT]
- **Environment Variables**: [dotenv]

## üîê Authentication

- All protected routes require a JWT token. To obtain a token:
- Register a new member via the /signup endpoint.
- Login using the /login endpoint to receive a token.
- Include the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for subsequent requests.

| Method | Endpoint | Headers | Body / Params | Description | Response |
|--------|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| POST | `/borrowBookById` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | `{ "userEmail": "john@example.com", "bookId": "book_id_here" }` | Borrow a book by ID | `{ "message": "Book borrowed successfully", "borrow": { ... } }` |
| POST | `/returnBookById/:borrowId` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Path param: `borrowId` | Return a borrowed book by borrow ID | `{ "message": "Book returned successfully" }` |
| GET | `/borrowsByMember` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | None | List all borrowed books by the authenticated member | `[ { "book": { ... }, "borrowDate": "date_here" }, ... ]` |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Reports

| Method | Endpoint | Headers | Body | Description | Response |
|--------|----------|---------|------|-------------|----------|
| POST | `/admin` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | `{}` | View library statistics, most borrowed books, and active members | `{ "bookStats": { "total": 120, "borrowed": 55, "available": 65 }, "borrowedBooks": [ { "title": "Book One", "count": 35 }, ... ], "activeMembers": [ { "name": "Alice", "count": 18 }, ... ] }` |

---

> **Note:**  
> - All protected routes require JWT in the `Authorization` header.  
> - `borrowBookById` and `returnBookById` are restricted to `Admin` and `Member`.  
> - `Admin` routes like `/books` and `/admin` require the user to have `Admin` role.
> -

## üõ°Ô∏è Middleware & Access Control

| Middleware | Description | Usage |
|------------|------------|-------|
| `adminOnly` | Restricts access to Admin users only. Requests from non-admins will receive a 403 Forbidden response. | Apply to routes that should only be accessible by admins, e.g., adding/updating/deleting books, viewing admin reports. |
| `authCheck` | Verifies the presence and validity of the JWT token in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`). Returns 401 Unauthorized if the token is missing or invalid. | Apply to routes that require authentication, e.g., fetching user profile or borrows. |
| `adminOrMember` | Allows access to both Admins and Members. Ensures that a valid JWT is provided and checks the user role. | Apply to routes where both roles can perform actions, e.g., borrowing or returning books. |

> **Usage Example in Express:**
```javascript
const { adminOnly, authCheck, adminOrMember } = require("../middlewares/Auth");

router.post("/books", adminOnly, async (req, res) => { ... });
router.get("/borrowsByMember", adminOrMember, async (req, res) => { ... });
